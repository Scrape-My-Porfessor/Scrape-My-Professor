# Scrape-My-Professor

## Description

A website hosted and partly built using Streamlit. Presents several visuals of UNT professor and class data. Gathers data from two sources: 1) Rate my Professor using an API. 2) JSON file with thousands of grades from professors and classes. 

## Todo

1. Parse JSON data more precisely to work with Rate my Professor data. For example, Rate my Professor may take Jon Doe as a input but the JSON will need it as Doe,Jon.
   
2. Specify how the user needs to input the class name and professor to provide more accurate results.
